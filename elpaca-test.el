;;; Commentary:

;; `elpaca-test' is a declarative macro aimed at making it easy to create and share bug reproduction enviornments.
;; Example usages:
;;
;; Installs Elpaca in a temporary environment. Launches an Emacs instance with doc/init.el
;; (elpaca-test)
;;
;; As above, but installs Elpaca and checks out the "feat/example" branch first.
;; (elpaca-test :ref "feat/example")
;;
;; As above, but copies over user's init.el
;; (elpaca-test :ref "feat/example" :init (:file "~/.emacs.d/init.el"))
;;
;; As above, with forms replacing everything after the installer in doc/init.el
;; (elpaca-test :ref "feat/example" :init (elpaca one) (elpaca two))

;; @TODO: Once elpaca-wait installed, re-implement to use yodel?

  "Test Elpaca in a clean environment.
BODY is a pseudo-plist which allows multiple values for certain keys.
The following keys are recognized:
  :name description of the test

  :ref git ref to check out or `local' to use local copy in current repo state

  :dir `user-emacs-directory' name expanded in `temporary-file-irectory'.
    Only relative paths are accepted.

  :init `user', (:file \"path/to/init.el\") or forms...
    Content of the init.el file.
    `user' is shorthand for `user-emacs-diretory'/init.el.

  :early-init `user', (:file \"path/to/early-init.el\") or forms...
    Content of the early-init.el file.
    `user' is shorthand for `user-emacs-diretory'/early-init.el.

  :keep t or a list containing any of the following symbols:
    `builds'
    `cache'
    `repos'
   If t, the directory is left in the state it was in as of last run.
   If a symbol list, those specific `elpaca-directory' folders are not removed."
